# scribbleplot
collection of my processing sketches used for transforming images to artsy plottable images (jpg/vector). Here are some output examples:

# randomLines [jpg,pdf]
![stylized image of cat](exampleResults/catResult.jpg)
![stylized image of cat](exampleResults/cat2Result.jpg)

# scribbleLines [jpg,pdf]
![stylized image of cat](exampleResults/scribble.jpg)
![stylized image of cat](exampleResults/scribble2.jpg)

# reactionDiffusion [jpg, needs to be vectorized]
![stylized image of cat](exampleResults/reactionDiffusion1.jpg)
